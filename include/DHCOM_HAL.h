 *
 *  <b>DHCOM_HAL</b> macro is preceding every public class declaration in the library.
 *
 *  For manual compiling of the library on Windows - do the <b>/D "DHCOM_HAL=__declspec(dllexport)"</b> in compiler command line.

/** \mainpage DHCOM HAL - hardware abstraction C++ class library for DHCOM modules.
 * DHCOM HAL class library is used to abstract application code from the underlying OS - and hardware - specific device drivers.
 * \n The library can be compiled to support several systems with similar executable binary formats (OS/CPU architectures).
 * \n In its current state the library supports:
 * \li UART, SPI, I2C, Physical Memory and GPIO for DHCOM Linux targets
 * \li UART for PC Linux targets
 * \li UART for PC Windows targets
 *
 * \section compile_sec Compiling
 * It is intended to compile the DHCOM HAL with Qt4 build system (qmake), though it does not use any of the Qt libraries. 
 * \n The project file for building is supplied with the library (DHCOM_HAL.pro).
 * \n To compile for DHCOM Modules use the Qt for DHCOM targets installation, supplied in the Debian building environment by DH Electronics.
 * \n Use options CONFIG+=DHCOM_AM35 or CONFIG+=DHCOM_iMX25 to compile support for DHCOM_AM35 or DHCOM_iMX25 modules, or both of them.
 *
 * \subsection win_pc_sec Configuring for Windows pc
 * If you want to configure for Windows PC, execute the following command from the Visual Studio command prompt:
 * \n <b> qmake -spec win32-msvc2008 -tp vc CONFIG=debug_and_release</b>
 * \n The MS Visual studio project will be created. 
 *
 * \subsection wince_dhcom_sec Configuring for DHCOM Module running Windows CE6 or CE7
 * Under construction... 
 *
 * \subsection linux_pc_sec Configuring for Linux PC 
 * You can configure the build for linux host the following way:
 * \n <b> qmake -spec linux-g++-32 CONFIG=debug_and_release</b>
 * \n The makefile project will be created.
 *
 * \subsection linux_dhcom_sec Configuring for DHCOM module running Linux.
 * You can configure the build for DHCOM modules running linux the following way:
 * \n <b> qmake -spec linux-arm-gnueabi-g++ CONFIG=debug_and_release</b>
 * \n The mkspec linux-arm-gnueabi-g++ must be in place to do this.
 * \n The makefile project will be created.
 *
 * \subsection manual_sec Manual configuration
 * It is always possible to configure the library for compilation without qmake. 
 * \n To do this on Windows:
 * \li In MSVC2008 create a smart device project, selecting the correct SDK
 * \li add all header files from <b>include</b> and <b>include/hal</b> into the project
 * \li add appropriate source files from the <b>src</b>
 * \li observe correctness of definitions of supported targets in System.h
 * \li define DHCOM_HAL macro as <b>/D "DHCOM_HAL=__declspec(dllexport)"</b>
 * \n
 * \n To manually compile on linux:
 * \li select the appropriate source files from src/Linux
 * \li include the \b include directory
 * \li observe correctness of definitions of supported targets in System.h (USE_HARDWARE_...)
 * \li create a Makefile or Eclipse project
